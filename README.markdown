# South: stateless authenticated sessions

See [this blog post](http://aykevl.nl/2015/01/south-stateless-authenticated-sessions-http-golang) for more background information about the protocol.

This package provides authentication tokens which can be used in place of the usual session IDs where the user ID is stored in the session data on the server.

Read for more information the [API documentation](http://godoc.org/github.com/aykevl93/south) at godoc.org.
